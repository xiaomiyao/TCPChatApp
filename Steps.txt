Phase 1: Establish Basic Communication Infrastructure
Create a Basic Echo Server:

Set up a TCP listener on a fixed port.

Accept one client connection.

Read a message from the client and echo it back.

Test this using telnet or a simple client.

Develop a Simple Client:

Create a client (console or WPF) that connects to the echo server.

Send a message from the client.

Listen for and display the echoed message.

Verify the client-server communication works.

Expand Server to Support Multiple Clients:

Modify the server to accept multiple client connections concurrently.

Maintain a list (e.g., List<TcpClient>) of all connected clients.

Update the server so that when a message is received, it’s echoed back to all connected clients (broadcasting).

Phase 2: Secure Communication
Integrate Message Encryption:

Implement an AES-based encryption helper in your Common library.

Update the client to encrypt messages before sending.

Update the server to decrypt incoming messages and encrypt responses.

Test end-to-end encrypted communication between client and server.

Phase 3: User Registration and Authentication
Design User Model:

Create a User.cs class with properties such as Id, Username, and PasswordHash.

(Optional) Use a secure method to store passwords (hashing).

Implement Registration:

Create functionality on the server to handle registration requests.

Store user information in your database (SQL Server via SSMS) or an in-memory structure for testing.

Test registration by sending user details from the client to the server.

Implement Authentication:

Create a login mechanism on the server that validates credentials.

Ensure the client can log in using a username and password.

Maintain session state for logged-in users.

Phase 4: Contact List Management
Design Contact Data Model:

Decide if contacts will be part of the User model or stored in a separate structure.

Each user should have a list of contacts (e.g., a list of user IDs).

Implement Contact List Functionality:

Add Contact: Allow users to add new contacts.

Edit Contact: Enable renaming or updating contact information.

Delete Contact: Allow removal of contacts.

Update the client UI (WPF) to support managing contacts.

Test each operation separately (add, edit, delete).

Phase 5: Messaging Functionalities
Direct (One-to-One) Messaging:

Allow a user to select a contact and send a private message.

Update the server to route the message to the intended recipient only.

Test by sending messages between two clients.

Group Messaging:

Implement functionality to create groups (or use broadcast logic for now).

Allow sending messages to multiple users simultaneously.

Test group messaging with several clients connected.

Phase 6: Blacklist Functionality
Design Blacklist Model:

Add a blacklist property to the user model (e.g., a list of blocked user IDs).

Implement Blacklist Management:

Add to Blacklist: Allow a user to block another user.

Edit/Delete Blacklist Entries: Enable updating or removing blocked users.

Update the server to check the blacklist before delivering a message.

Test by blocking a user and verifying that their messages are not delivered.

Phase 7: User Status Tracking
Implement Status Notifications:

When a user logs in, have the server notify all their contacts that the user is online.

When a user logs out, notify contacts that the user is offline.

Update the client UI to display these status changes.

Test by logging in/out from different clients and checking notifications.

Phase 8: Message History Storage
Design Message History Model:

Create a Message class with properties such as sender, recipient, timestamp, and content.

Plan for storing these messages in your database.

Implement Message History Persistence:

On the server, save every message to SQL Server (using ADO.NET or an ORM like Entity Framework).

Create methods to retrieve the conversation history for a specific contact.

Test by sending messages, then retrieving and displaying the history.

Phase 9: Search Functionality
Implement Contact Search:

Add a search bar in the client to filter contacts by name or a part of the name.

Test the search function with various inputs.

Implement Message Search:

By Specific User: Allow searching for messages exchanged with a specific user.

Across All Users: Enable searching through all message histories for a keyword.

Update the UI to display search results.

Test both search scenarios to ensure accurate filtering.

Phase 10: Final Integration and Testing
Integration Testing:

Run the complete application (server and multiple clients).

Test full user flows: registration, login, managing contacts, sending/receiving messages, blacklist, status notifications, message history, and search functionality.

Enhance UI and Error Handling:

Refine the WPF UI with proper data binding and MVVM if desired.

Add comprehensive error handling and logging on both client and server sides.

Test robustness by simulating disconnections and errors.

Documentation and Final Code Review:

Document your code and overall architecture.

Prepare a README with instructions on how to build and run the application.

Conduct a final review and refactor code as needed.
