1. **Create a Basic Echo Server:**
   1.1. Set up a TCP listener on a fixed port.  
   1.2. Accept one client connection.  
   1.3. Read a message from the client and echo it back.  
   1.4. Test this using telnet or a simple client.

2. **Develop a Simple Client:**
   2.1. Create a client (console or WPF) that connects to the echo server.  
   2.2. Send a message from the client.  
   2.3. Listen for and display the echoed message.  
   2.4. Verify the client-server communication works.

3. **Expand Server to Support Multiple Clients:**
   3.1. Modify the server to accept multiple client connections concurrently.  
   3.2. Maintain a list (e.g., a List<TcpClient>) of all connected clients.  
   3.3. Update the server so that when a message is received, it�s echoed back to all connected clients (broadcasting).

4. **Integrate Message Encryption:**
   4.1. Implement an AES-based encryption helper in your Common library.  
   4.2. Update the client to encrypt messages before sending.  
   4.3. Update the server to decrypt incoming messages and encrypt responses.  
   4.4. Test end-to-end encrypted communication between client and server.

5. **Design User Model for Registration and Authentication:**
   5.1. Create a User.cs class with properties such as Id, Username, and PasswordHash.  
   5.2. (Optional) Use a secure method to store passwords (hashing).

6. **Implement User Registration:**
   6.1. Create functionality on the server to handle registration requests.  
Define a Registration Message Structure

Extend the existing message/envelope models (or create new ones) to include registration details.
Decide on a message type (e.g., "Register") to distinguish registration requests.
Extend the Server Message Handling

In the server’s message loop (e.g., in ClientHandler), add a branch to detect registration messages using the new type.
Deserialize the registration payload into a registration model.
Implement User Registration Logic

Validate the received registration details (e.g., check for empty username/password).
Use a secure method (e.g., a hash function) to generate and store the password hash.
Decide where to store the new user (a database or an in-memory list for testing).
Send an Acknowledgement

Create and send a response message back to the client indicating registration success or failure.
Ensure this response is appropriately encrypted and serialized.
Log and Handle Errors

Log registration attempts and any errors for troubleshooting.
Implement error handling to manage duplicate registrations or malformed data.
Testing

Use a client (or unit tests) to send registration requests.
Verify that new users are stored and the client receives the proper response.


   6.2. Store user information in your database (SQL Server via SSMS) or an in-memory structure for testing.  
   6.3. Test registration by sending user details from the client to the server.

7. **Implement User Authentication:**
   7.1. Create a login mechanism on the server that validates credentials.  
   7.2. Ensure the client can log in using a username and password.  
   7.3. Maintain session state for logged-in users.

8. **Design Contact List Management:**
   8.1. Decide if contacts will be part of the User model or stored in a separate structure.  
   8.2. Each user should have a list of contacts (e.g., a list of user IDs).

9. **Implement Contact List Functionality:**
   9.1. Add Contact � allow users to add new contacts.  
   9.2. Edit Contact � enable renaming or updating contact information.  
   9.3. Delete Contact � allow removal of contacts.  
   9.4. Update the client UI (WPF) to support managing contacts.  
   9.5. Test each operation separately (add, edit, delete).

10. **Implement Direct (One-to-One) Messaging:**
    10.1. Allow a user to select a contact and send a private message.  
    10.2. Update the server to route the message to the intended recipient only.  
    10.3. Test by sending messages between two clients.

11. **Implement Group Messaging:**
    11.1. Implement functionality to create groups (or use broadcast logic for now).  
    11.2. Allow sending messages to multiple users simultaneously.  
    11.3. Test group messaging with several clients connected.

12. **Implement Blacklist Functionality:**
    12.1. Design a Blacklist Model � add a blacklist property to the User model (e.g., a list of blocked user IDs).  
    12.2. Add to Blacklist � allow a user to block another user.  
    12.3. Edit/Delete Blacklist Entries � enable updating or removing blocked users.  
    12.4. Update the server to check the blacklist before delivering a message.  
    12.5. Test by blocking a user and verifying that their messages are not delivered.

13. **Implement User Status Tracking:**
    13.1. When a user logs in, have the server notify all their contacts that the user is online.  
    13.2. When a user logs out, notify contacts that the user is offline.  
    13.3. Update the client UI to display these status changes.  
    13.4. Test by logging in/out from different clients and checking notifications.

14. **Implement Message History Storage:**
    14.1. Design a Message model with properties such as sender, recipient, timestamp, and content.  
    14.2. Plan for storing these messages in your database (SQL Server).  
    14.3. On the server, save every message to SQL Server (using ADO.NET or an ORM like Entity Framework).  
    14.4. Create methods to retrieve the conversation history for a specific contact.  
    14.5. Test by sending messages, then retrieving and displaying the history.

15. **Implement Search Functionality:**
    15.1. Implement Contact Search � add a search bar in the client to filter contacts by name or a part of the name.  
    15.2. Implement Message Search by Specific User � allow searching for messages exchanged with a specific user.  
    15.3. Implement Message Search Across All Users � enable searching through all message histories for a keyword.  
    15.4. Update the UI to display search results.  
    15.5. Test both search scenarios to ensure accurate filtering.

16. **Final Integration and Testing:**
    16.1. Run the complete application (server and multiple clients) and test full user flows: registration, login, managing contacts, sending/receiving messages, blacklist, status notifications, message history, and search functionality.  
    16.2. Enhance the WPF UI with proper data binding and, if desired, adopt the MVVM pattern.  
    16.3. Add comprehensive error handling and logging on both client and server sides.  
    16.4. Test robustness by simulating disconnections and errors.

17. **Documentation and Final Code Review:**
    17.1. Document your code and overall architecture.  
    17.2. Prepare a README with instructions on how to build and run the application.  
    17.3. Conduct a final review and refactor code as needed.
